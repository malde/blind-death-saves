# Secret Death Saves

<sup>(the module formerly known as _Blind Death Saves_)</sup>

This is a very simple module with the intent of lowering the visibility of death saves for the players. It is intended for use with the _dnd5e_ system and supports the vanilla and tidy5e character sheets. May or may not work with other rolling modules.

The module provides two modes of operation:

## Blind Death Saves

This is the default mode and automatically activated after module installation.

- forces death saves to automatically be rolled as a Blind GM Roll
- hides the results of death saves on the character sheet for the player, but still displays it for the GM

## Private Death Saves

This can be activated by changing the mode to _Private_ in the module settings.

- forces death saves to automatically be rolled as a Private GM Roll
- does _not_ hide the results of death saves on the player's character sheet
